# zheng-s-workspace

The Reason:
Well, couple of days before, when I was doing some comments on my pdf file,
(I like to do some comments on the books I read) 
well, as you can imagin, it is crashed...
so this file cannot be read any more.(before I am educated enough to mend it)
After this accident, I want to learn some tech to help me to store the data.
Introducing from my friend Dai, I try Git.
And here we go.   2015/04/11
